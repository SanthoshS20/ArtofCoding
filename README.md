# ArtofCoding
Bringing all Data Structures and Algorithms under one Roof âš¡

## Overview

The goal of this project is to have in a single place all possible algorithms and data structures - in multiple languages. We aim to achieve this collaboratively, so feel free to contribute in any way you want, just make sure to follow the contribution guidelines listed below.

## Contents

Our content is divided by programming language. Please create an issue if you wish to add code in a language that we don't currently have here. **Do not create folders in your submissions, unless specifically told to do so.**

- [Python](/Python/README.md)

# Contributing Guidelines

- **Plagiarism is strictly not allowed**. Any work that is found to be suspicious of plagiarized work will not be merged.
- Issues will be assigned on a _first come, first serve_ basis. You just have to comment on the issue, asking to be assigned, and it will be done if found fit.
- Preferably, you cannot work on any issue that is not assigned to you.
- In case you want to submit an improvement to an existing algorithm, we prefer that you create an issue, describing in details your improvement. This will help others to analyze your contribution. You can use the [templates](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/algorithm-ds-proposal.md) that we have provided :)
- If you have anything else in mind, create an issue and please wait for it to be assigned to you. You can then start working on it and create a PR.
- All PRs must be made from a Branch. Create a separate branch for every Issue you are working upon and once found fit, make a PR.
- If you have no idea what are issues or PRs, please do refer to [this link](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/wiki/What-is-a-Pull-Request-and-how-to-do-it%3F)

Make sure your code works before submitting it :D

### Where to upload the files

**PLEASE READ THIS**

- Your files should be uploaded directly into the corresponding folder (e.g. if you wrote code for a Data Structure in Python, it goes inside the DS folder within the Python folder and so on)
- Edit the corresponding _README.md_ file to **add the link to your code in the corresponding section** ([GitHub Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
- **Under no circumstances create new folders within the language folders to upload your code unless specifically told to do so**.
- Also, be polite with the reviewers - they will be ALWAYS polite to you.
